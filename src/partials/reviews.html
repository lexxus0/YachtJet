            The Sunseeker Manhattan 66 was the perfect choice for our romantic
            getaway. The yacht was beautifully designed, with all the amenities
            we needed, and the crew was attentive and friendly.

            The Azimut 80 was the most luxurious yacht I've ever been on. The
            cabins were spacious and elegant, and the outdoor areas were perfect
            for relaxing and entertaining. Worth every penny!
